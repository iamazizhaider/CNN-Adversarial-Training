### Semester Project
> Adversarial Training for Enhanced Image Recognition Security

### Abstract
> This project focuses on enhancing the security of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), against adversarial attacks in image recognition tasks. We explore two adversarial attacks in our project which are Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and L0 Norm. Through experimentation we showed that mixing adversarial images with normal training data can improve systemâ€™s accuracy against adversarial attacks . Additionally, we propose leveraging the model itself to generate adversarial images for improved defense using PyTorch Framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in strengthening the model resilience against attacks and increase its robustness.
