    "### Abstract\n",
    "> This project focuses on enhancing the security of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), against adversarial attacks in image recognition tasks. We explore two adversarial attacks in our project which are Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and L0 Norm. Through experimentation we showed that mixing adversarial images with normal training data can improve system’s accuracy against adversarial attacks . Additionally, we propose leveraging the model itself to generate adversarial images for improved defense using PyTorch Framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in strengthening the model resilience against attacks and increase its robustness.\n",

    "> It can be seen that the performance of the model increases drastically when it is adversarially trained on examples generated by PDGM. Without adversarially training, the model failed to predict test images for eps = 0.30, giving a worst accuracy of 2.80%. But after the adversarially training, the model successfully predicted them with confidence of 54.27%"

    "> This research-based project gives basis to further developments in the field of adversarial training of the deep neural networks by providing methods to create adversarial examples and then using them to train the model to improve its performance. We used two methods, namely <b>Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)</b> and <b>Projected Gradient Descent Method (PGDM)</b> to generate adversarial examples and proved that the latter (PGDM) is much more effective than FGSM and helps the model to become more robust. With PGDM, through experimentation, we showed that the model accuracy can be increased from 2.80% to 54.27%, showing significant increase in model efficiency to detect adversarial examples."
